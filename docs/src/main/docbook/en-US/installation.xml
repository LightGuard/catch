   <para>
      The Seam Catch API is the only compile time dependency a project needs, and an implementation must also be
      included, either explicitly or via some other module depending on it (and exposing their own specialized
      extensions) is all that is needed during runtime. If you are using
      <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</ulink>
      as your build tool, you can add the following dependency to
      your pom.xml file:

   <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
         <artifactId>seam-catch-api</artifactId>
         <version>${seam-catch-version}</version>
         <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>

      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
         <artifactId>seam-catch-impl</artifactId>
         <version>${seam-catch-version}</version>
         <scope>runtime</scope>
      </dependency>]]>
   </programlisting>
   <note>
      <para>
         The runtime dependency is only needed if another Seam 3 module being used doesn't already use it. Typically
         this will only be for Java SE development.
      </para>
   </note>
   <tip>
      <para>
         Replace ${seam-catch-version} with the most recent or appropriate version of Seam Catch.
      </para>
   </tip>
