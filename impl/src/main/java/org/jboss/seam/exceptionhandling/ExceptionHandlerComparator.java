    * In the foregoing description, the notation
    * <tt>sgn(</tt><i>expression</i><tt>)</tt> designates the mathematical
    * <i>signum</i> function, which is defined to return one of <tt>-1</tt>,
    * <tt>0</tt>, or <tt>1</tt> according to whether the value of
    * <i>expression</i> is negative, zero or positive.<p>
    * <p/>
    * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) ==
    * -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  (This
    * implies that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only
    * if <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
    * <p/>
    * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
    * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
    * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>
    * <p/>
    * Finally, the implementor must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt>
    * implies that <tt>sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all
    * <tt>z</tt>.<p>
    * <p/>
    * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
    * <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</tt>.  Generally speaking,
    * any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate
    * this fact.  The recommended language is "Note: this comparator
    * imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals."

    *         second.
    * @throws ClassCastException if the arguments' types prevent them from
    *                            being compared by this comparator.
